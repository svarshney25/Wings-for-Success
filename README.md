# Wings-for-Success
This app was created as part of my volunteer internship at a local nonprofit, Wings for Success. The app accompanies the organization's 
website and allows users to book appointments, donate, volunteer, or book 1:1 advice sessions. The IBAction functions were used to connect
the buttons to webpages, ZStack and VStack was used to organize the text for the job advice pages, and TabView was used to created the scrolling 
images for the fashion tips pages. The storyboard implements a Scrollview for all of the pages to allow people of different screen sizes
to scroll. Unfortunately, the constraints do not work, so the best device to view it on is an iPhone 11. However, the scroll feature should
enable the user to manipulate the screens.
